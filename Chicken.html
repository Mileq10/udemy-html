        <h2>The Elephant</h2>
        <p>An elephant slept in his bunk,<br>
            And in slumber his chest rose and <br>
            But he snored â€” how he snored! <br>
            All the other beasts roared,<br>
            So his wife tied a knot in his trunk. <br> </p>

            The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from
            Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a
            cockerel.
            A male that has been castrated is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capon">capon</a>. An adult female
            bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female
            is called a pullet. <sup>[2]</sup>
